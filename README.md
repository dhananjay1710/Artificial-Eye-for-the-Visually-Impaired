# Artificial-Eye-for-the-Visually-Impaired
 
 The static implementation of the file has been recorded in the demoStatic.ipynb
 
 ## Download Weights and complete directory: 
 
 In order to implement it correctly, first download the complete repository from the google drive link:
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x0Ua5Y4-NjnLpukS1CAxAdy6ZVmaCOcl?usp=sharing
 
 As the weights and many other files could not be implemented to the google drive.
 Once downloaded, proceed to run the cells of the file.
 
 ## Running the file: 
 
 The comments should make the file easily readable. Now, the user has a fully functional model capable of identifying objects in the view and outputing their type and location in an audio format with the help of google's text to speech API.
 
 ## For further explanations:
